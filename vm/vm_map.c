/*
 *	Virtual memory maps provide for the mapping, protection,
 *	and sharing of virtual memory objects.  In addition,
 *	this module provides for an efficient virtual copy of
 *	memory from one map to another.
 *
 *	Synchronization is required prior to most operations.
 *
 *	Maps consist of an ordered doubly-linked list of simple
 *	entries; a hint and a red-black tree are used to speed up lookups.
 *
 *	Sharing maps have been deleted from this version of Mach.
 *	All shared objects are now mapped directly into the respective
 *	maps.  This requires a change in the copy on write strategy;
 *	the asymmetric (delayed) strategy is used for shared temporary
 *	objects instead of the symmetric (shadow) strategy.  This is
 *	selected by the (new) use_shared_copy bit in the object.  See
 *	vm_object_copy_temporary in vm_object.c for details.  All maps
 *	are now "top level" maps (either task map, kernel map or submap
 *	of the kernel map).
 *
 *	Since portions of maps are specified by start/end addresses,
 *	which may not align with existing map entries, all
 *	routines merely "clip" entries to these start/end values.
 *	[That is, an entry is split into two, bordering at a
 *	start or end value.]  Note that these clippings may not
 *	always be necessary (as the two resulting entries are then
 *	not changed); however, the clipping is done for convenience.
 *	The entries can later be "glued back together" (coalesced).
 *
 *	The symmetric (shadow) copy strategy implements virtual copy
 *	by copying VM object references from one map to
 *	another, and then marking both regions as copy-on-write.
 *	It is important to note that only one writeable reference
 *	to a VM object region exists in any map when this strategy
 *	is used -- this means that shadow object creation can be
 *	delayed until a write operation occurs.  The asymmetric (delayed)
 *	strategy allows multiple maps to have writeable references to
 *	the same region of a vm object, and hence cannot delay creating
 *	its copy objects.  See vm_object_copy_temporary() in vm_object.c.
 *	Copying of permanent objects is completely different; see
 *	vm_object_copy_strategically() in vm_object.c.
